My name is Chelsea Tandyo and I am a Bachelor of Information Technology student at James Cook University Singapore. As part of my studies, I am currently focused on enhancing my programming skills, particularly in Python.

# Key Takeaways:

Throughout this course, I have gained valuable insights regarding the importance of writing clean code. Here are three fundamental lessons I have learned:

Naming Conventions: Adopting clear and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes greatly enhances code readability and maintainability.
Code Organization: Breaking down code into functions and classes promotes modularity, reusability, and facilitates testing and debugging processes.
Comments and Documentation: Utilizing comments to elucidate complex or ambiguous code sections, along with employing docstrings to provide comprehensive information about the purpose and usage of functions and classes.
